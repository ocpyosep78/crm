IMPORTANT

This project is not ready for open source collaboration, nor is it a general use CRM (yet). It is the working copy for a particular company I'm working for. However, I did code it with the intention to provide some kind of framework for building web applications (in particular, CRMs) and it just needs a little tuning to set that clear (separate what's the core of the application from what belongs to this particular implementation, mainly).



INSTALL / TEST RUNS

If you want to test the application, make sure to set read/write permission for these folders:

/logs/
/temp/
/app/images/products/

At this point, no other folder is required to be granted write access.

The database should be working with /sql/crm_minimal.sql.gz imported, once you set connection parameters in /app/cfg/config.cfg.php

	# Database access
	define('CRM_HOST', 'localhost', true);
	define('CRM_USER', 'root', true);
	define('CRM_PASS', YOUR_PASS, true);
	define('CRM_DB', YOUR_DATABASE, true);

The reason why there's a third parameter set to true is that we want to re-define these constants in ./app/cfg/local.cfg.php (among other constants in this config script) for local settings like DEVELOPER_MODE, DB params, or debug flags. The file local.cfg.php is not included in the repository, nor is it required. Add it to your local working copy to add developer tools and full access, or to personalize other values without having to worry about committing or pushing the wrong config.cfg.php version. I'll probably document it better when I have time to.
