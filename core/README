CORE FOLDER BRIEFING

/private/
This folder contains files that are not meant to be editted during the coding of an application using AppTemplate framework. Unless you plan to modify the framework itself, it is strongly suggested not to mess with this folder.

/public/
Tools to tune or modify the behaviour of AppTemplate are located in this folder. This includes configuration files, module definitions and behaviour scripts.



Read /public/README for information on the framework's API.
Read /private/README for information on contributing to the development of the framework.
